      "Good leaders don’t get ahead because they’re better at the details—they get ahead because they’re better at *people*. It all starts with a clear, compelling *why*.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **They define a purpose profit or performance.**  \n",
      "   The *why* gives the team a reason to show up every day, even when the work is hard. When people understand “why we’re doing this,” they align their personal purpose with the organization’s purpose, creating a shared commitment that is far stronger than any metric.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **They build safety and trust.**  \n",
      "   A leader’s first responsibility is to create an environment where people can step out of their shells. Fitzpatrick’s research on “psychological safety” shows that teams that feel safe are the ones that innovate, grow, and actually deliver extraordinary results. If people fear judgment, they never speak up, and if they can’t speak up, they never learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **They practice radical empathy.**  \n",
      "   Leadership is a conversation, not a monologue. Listening is an act of respect. When a leader genuinely looks to understand—not just to respond—people feel seen, valued, and understood. Remember: the best leaders keep asking, “How am I serving this person?” Instead of “How can I get this done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **They communicate the story.**  \n",
      "   A story is more powerful than data because it engages the heart first. Leaders frame objectives as part of a larger narrative—why this matter matters to the community, how it changes lives. When employees see the narrative, they connect passionately to the mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **They empower, not micromanage.**  \n",
      "   Leadership is about expanding others’ capacity. Providing resources, setting clear expectations, then stepping back—allowing people to own the process—produces buy‑in, accountability, and ambition that scales. When you trust people with the right level of autonomy, they rise to the occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **They’re honest about uncertainty.**  \n",
      "   A great leader does not pretend certainty is a sign of competence. Admitting unknowns invites collaboration, sparks inventiveness, and builds resilience. It creates a culture that is comfortable with risk because the leader is navigating it openly, not hiding it behind a façade of infallibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **They practice constant learning.**  \n",
      "   The best leaders are perpetual students—reading, listening, seeking out feedback, often from people who do not agree with them. Their humility leads others to step up, creating a learning organization in which continuous improvement is the norm.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** A good leader is someone who *clearly articulates why* they exist, *creates a safe space* for people to grow, *listens with the intent to understand*, *models trust and empathy*, and *gives others the tools they need* to take ownership. When those qualities align, you begin to see people not just perform, but *thrive*. And that’s the real measure of leadership.\n"

      "   **Abstract**: Prosody conveys rich emotional and semantic information of the speech signal as well as individual idiosyncrasies. We propose a stand-alone model that maps text-to-prosodic features such as F0 and energy and can be used in downstream tasks such as TTS. The ProMode encoder takes as input acoustic features and time-aligned textual content, both are partially masked, and obtains a fixed-length latent prosodic embedding. The decoder predicts acoustics in the masked region using both the encoded prosody input and unmasked textual content. Trained on the GigaSpeech dataset, we compare our method with state-of-the-art style encoders. For F0 and energy predictions, we show consistent improvements for our model at different levels of granularity. We also integrate these predicted prosodic features into a TTS system and conduct perceptual tests, which show higher prosody preference compared to the baselines, demonstrating the model\\'s potential in tasks where prosody modeling is important.  \n",

      "   **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks to be performed through simple prompt-based interactions. Consequently, several approaches have been proposed to engineer prompts that most effectively enable LLMs to perform a given task (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting). In settings with a well-defined metric to optimize model performance, automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have been developed to refine a seed prompt. Advancing this line of research, we propose APIO, a simple but effective prompt induction and optimization approach for the tasks of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and Text Simplification, without relying on manually specified seed prompts. APIO achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for purely LLM-based prompting methods on these tasks. We make our data, code, prompts, and outputs publicly available.  \n",

      "   **Authors**: Ju-Chieh Chou, Jiawei Zhou, Karen Livescu  \n",
      "   **Abstract**: Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic details. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic information by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued representation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to predict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the design space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic tokens helps preserve linguistic information. Our approach achieves comparable performance to existing models in terms of linguistic likelihood benchmarks, while providing better acoustic detail in prompted generation.  \n",

      "   **Authors**: Nikita Mehrotra, Aayush Kumar, Sumit Gulwani, Arjun Radhakrishna, Ashish Tiwari  \n",
      "   **Abstract**: We present a neurosymbolic approach, TEN, for extracting tabular data from semistructured input text. This task is particularly challenging for text input that does not use special delimiters consistently to separate columns and rows. Purely neural approaches perform poorly due to hallucinations and their inability to enforce hard constraints. TEN uses Structural Decomposition prompting - a specialized chain-of-thought prompting approach - on a large language model (LLM) to generate an initial table, and thereafter uses a symbolic checker to evaluate not only the well-formedness of that table, but also detect cases of hallucinations or forgetting. The output of the symbolic checker is processed by a critique-LLM to generate guidance for fixing the table, which is presented to the original LLM in a self-debug loop. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that TEN significantly outperforms purely neural baselines across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving significantly higher exact match accuracy and substantially reduced hallucination rates. A 21-participant user study further confirms that TEN's tables are rated significantly more accurate (mean score: 5.0 vs 4.3; p = 0.021), and are consistently preferred for ease of verification and correction, with participants favoring our method in over 60% of the cases.  \n",

      "   **Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute \"gold standard\" for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset, the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training.

We propose a stand-alone model that maps text-to-prosodic features such as F0 and energy and can be used in downstream tasks such as TTS. The ProMode encoder takes as input acoustic features and time-aligned textual content, both are partially masked, and obtains a fixed-length latent prosodic embedding.</div>\n",

      "        <div class=\"abstract\">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks to be performed through simple prompt-based interactions. Consequently, several approaches have been proposed to engineer prompts that most effectively enable LLMs to perform a given task. In settings with a well-defined metric to optimize model performance, automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods have been developed to refine a seed prompt.</div>\n",

      "        <div class=\"abstract\">Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic details.</div>\n",

      "        <div class=\"abstract\">We present a neurosymbolic approach, TEN, for extracting tabular data from semistructured input text. This task is particularly challenging for text input that does not use special delimiters consistently to separate columns and rows. Purely neural approaches perform poorly due to hallucinations and their inability to enforce hard constraints. TEN uses Structural Decomposition prompting - a specialized chain-of-thought prompting approach.</div>\n",
